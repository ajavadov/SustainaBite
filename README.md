Revolutionizing the culinary experience

# Culinary Companion

## Inspiration

Our commitment to enhancing meal decisions and reducing food waste fuels our inspiration. Driven by a passion for sustainability, we embarked on a mission to transform the culinary experience.

## What it Does

**Culinary Companion** is a state-of-the-art food recommendation system that harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neural Networks, and Collaborative Filtering. Operating seamlessly on iOS and supported by Google Cloud, our app boasts an exceptional UI/UX, empowering users to make informed and sustainable choices effortlessly.

The system efficiently processes user preferences, from the moment the app is opened, through past meal selections, ongoing preferences during usage, and the interests of similar users. This comprehensive approach ensures robust recommendations, offering both reliable choices and enticing options to explore new culinary experiences.

## How We Built It

In an intense 36-hour hackathon sprint, we engineered a robust iOS app with a backend on Google Cloud. Our recommendation engine intricately analyzes ingredients and user behavior, delivering personalized suggestions with precision.

Our recommendation system operates in two modes. In Selection-Based mode, NLP analyzes meal ingredients, mapping them to similar meals for recommendations. The Hybrid mode enhances this by considering the choices of users with closely aligned interests, refining recommendations for greater personalization.

## Challenges 

Our primary challenges centered on refining the ranking algorithm of the recommendation system. We explored multiple approaches to strike a balance between user preference accuracy and the novelty of meal suggestions.

## Accomplishments

- Successfully developed a feature-rich iOS app with a polished UI/UX.
- Integrated NLP, Neural Networks, and Collaborative Filtering for precise recommendations.
- Established a reliable Google Cloud backend for scalability.
- Addressed sustainability concerns by incorporating CO2 emissions data in our app.


The hackathon experience illuminated the power of rapid prototyping, collaborative efforts, and the pivotal role technology plays in fostering sustainable practices in the food industry.

## What's Next 

Moving forward, our goals include expanding the app's accessibility, refining recommendation algorithms, and exploring partnerships to amplify our sustainability initiatives. By providing CO2 emissions information, we empower users to make eco-conscious food choices, contributing to a greener future. Join us on this journey towards a more sustainable and flavorful world!
